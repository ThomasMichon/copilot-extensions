# agent-machines setup

> **Before you start — readiness (self-provisioning, no agent-worktrees required).**
> The runtime can run standalone. Discovery uses agent-worktrees registries when
> they exist, but missing registries just mean "no packages discovered." In an
> agent session, invoke the exact `argv` from the agent-machines session command
> catalog; the payload-local command provisions the runtime on first use. Do not
> search `PATH` or substitute a same-named command from another payload.
>
> Outside an agent session, stamp a management binstub from an explicitly chosen
> payload; the first command then builds the venv on demand.
>
> Windows:
> ```powershell
> $s = Join-Path '<explicit-payload-path>' 'scripts\init.ps1'
> & $s stamp
> ```
>
> POSIX:
> ```bash
> bash "<explicit-payload-path>/scripts/init.sh" stamp
> ```
>
> The first call may take ~30–120s. POSIX emits `::agent-provisioning::`; Windows
> prints a provisioning message. If provisioning fails, surface the exact message.

## Install / update the runtime

`agent-machines` is a runtime CLI (a venv plus a `~/.local/bin/agent-machines`
binstub; on Windows the executable shim is `agent-machines.cmd`). The
session-start hook reconciles the runtime only; it never runs machine-state
`restore`. To (re)deploy the runtime from the source folder after a payload
update:

```
# from the plugin's source dir (marketplace install path or a local checkout)
scripts\init.ps1         # Windows
scripts/init.sh          # Linux / WSL / macOS
```

Verify:

```
<catalog argv[0]> version                    # inside an agent session
<management-binstub-path> version            # outside a session
```

## Author a requirement package

A **requirement package** is one YAML file under a repo's
`.github/machine-state/`. Minimal shape:

```yaml
schema_version: 1
package: <owner>/<name>            # e.g. myrepo/copilot-defaults
gate: [this-machine, other-machine]  # omit or ["*"] for all machines
aliases:
  HOME:      { kind: home }
  REPO:      { kind: repo, name: myrepo }
  WORKTREES: { kind: worktree-glob, repo: myrepo }
manage:
  copilot.settings:                # -> ~/.copilot/settings.json
    disposition: enforce           # scalars: model, effortLevel, ...
    values: { model: <model>, effortLevel: high }
  copilot.permissions:             # -> ~/.copilot/permissions-config.json
    disposition: ensure-present    # union floor; never clobbers live grants
per-machine:                       # default <- per-machine (null unsets)
  other-machine:
    manage:
      copilot.settings:
        values: { model: null }
exclude:                           # capture must never serialize these
  - "mcp-oauth-config/**"
```

**Value-shape guidance:** scalar singletons (`model`, `effortLevel`) are
`enforce`; maps/lists (`enabledPlugins`, `permissions`) are `ensure-present` so
several repos compose by union. Do not explicitly disable bootstrap-critical
plugins (`agent-worktrees`, `agent-machines`); if a package manages
`extraKnownMarketplaces`, include the bootstrap-critical `copilot-extensions`
marketplace or the validator errors.

Run `<catalog argv[0]> validate` after authoring to catch conflicts.
